# ABOUT 3D HEALS
3D Heals is a company dedicated to fostering education and resources in the realm of 3D printing for healthcare applications. Its mission is to bring together professionals from diverse fields such as medicine, dentistry, and engineering to exchange knowledge and collaborate on advancing 3D printing technologies within the healthcare industry.

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Our team developed a predictive model aimed at identifying users' preferred communication channels, including email, social media, and web platforms. The project was based on a comprehensive dataset, which included event attendance records, effectiveness of various communication channels (such as MailChimp, LinkedIn, and the website), and user preferences across different seasons and industries. This data was crucial for analyzing audience engagement and shaping the predictive model.

# PROJECT WORKFLOW
Here is an overview of the steps followed in this project:

**Business Problem:** The focus was to improve the efficiency of communication strategies within the 3D printing healthcare sector.

**SWOT Analysis:** Conducted an in-depth SWOT analysis to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with 3D printing in healthcare.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in attendance, channel preferences, and interest in topics over time.

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the dataset by eliminating duplicates, correcting errors, and addressing missing values.

**Feature Selection:** Applied Lasso regularization to identify the key features influencing users' preferred communication channels.

**Modeling:** Built predictive models using Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms to forecast user communication preferences.

**Model Comparison and Selection:** Evaluated the models based on their accuracy and F1 scores to determine the best-performing one.

**Observations & Findings:** Recorded key insights from the modeling phase, emphasizing the most important factors for predicting communication channel preferences.

**Recommendations and Further Research:** Offered strategic recommendations based on the project's outcomes and suggested areas for future research and optimization.
